### README

Consider me read!

...

Note: The **setup.aux.temp.R** file contains the actual script I ran at
the time while the **.Rmd** file contains the same essential elements and
produces the same output. Nevertheless, be sure to examine the original
if there is any confusion with the **.Rmd** file.  

Also, I have no idea what a "gh-pages branch" is... Sorry.
